Introduction
-------

When working with this version of the editor, or the extension addon, you will need to use specific versions of the 
nuget packages for your project. This has been tested with v2.1-beta6.

For this document, we will use *nix style paths. If you are a Windows user, please convert lines like `/path/to/` to 
`C:\path\to\` so that it will work with your system. MacOS users can use the *nix paths.

The editor builds have a file named `mono_instructions.txt` included in the zipped release.
The contents of this file are as follows:

```
If you have GodotSharp locally cached dotnet may use one of them instead. To clear local cache run the following command:
dotnet nuget locals all --clear

To add the local nuget source, please run the following command:
dotnet nuget add source /path/to/nuget_packages/ --name LuaAPINugetSource

```

What this is saying is that you will want to open up a command prompt and do the following steps to install the correct 
nuget packages into your project. If you have downloaded the editor zip file, it comes with a directory named `nuget_packages` 
This is the directory that you will want to include into the second step in the instructions file. So, if you have extracted 
the Editor to `C:\Users\username\Godot` the correct path to use would be `C:\Users\username\Godot\nuget_packages`. 
Likewise, if you extracted the editor to `/home/username/Godot/` you would want to use `/home/username/Godot/nuget_packages`.

Make sure to enclose directories with spaces with either a `"` or `'` so that the path resolves correctly.

Commands
-------

In your command prompt, execute these commands in the following order.

`dotnet nuget locals all --clear`

`dotnet nuget add source /path/to/nuget_packages/ --name LuaAPINugetSource`

This will set up the proper packages to work with the Editor / Add-on. Note: you may have to select the correct nuget 
source within your IDE. If so, please use the `LuaAPINugetSource` option.

Once you have done this, you will need to rebuild your project. You can do so either through your IDE or inside of the 
Godot Editor.

Example Notes
-------

As you can expect, the method names in the LuaAPI class are in Dotnet style. So, something like `LuaAPI.push_variant` 
would be `LuaAPI.PushVariant`

Starter Example:
```csharp
using Godot;
using System;

public partial class Node2D : Godot.Node2D
{
	// Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		GD.Print("Hello from C#");
		LuaApi lua = new LuaApi();
		lua.DoString("print(\"Hello from Lua\")");
	}
}
```
Note that `lua.DoString()` is the dotnet version of `lua.do_string()`.

The above starter example will produce its output into the Godot Output window in the Godot Editor. Here is the exact 
output it produces.
```
Hello from C#
Hello from Lua
```

More examples will be included very soon.
